# Iris-data-analysis

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. The data set: The data set contains 150 observations of iris flowers. There are four columns of measurements of the flowers in centimetres. The fifth column is the species of the flower observed. All observed flowers belong to one of three species.
